The task
----------
[Use the Twitchtv JSON API](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api)

### Objective
Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo)

### Rules
* Use whichever libraries or APIs you need

### User stories
* I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv
* I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel
* If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming
* I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account 
  never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers
* I can search through the streams listed

### Hints
* See an example call to Twitch.tv's JSONP API at https://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/use-the-twitchtv-json-api/19541
* The relevant documentation about this API call is here: 
  https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/v5/reference/streams/#get-stream-by-user
* Here's an array of the Twitch.tv usernames of people who regularly stream: 
  ```javascript
  ["ESL_SC2", "OgamingSC2", "cretetion", "freecodecamp", 
  "storbeck", "habathcx", "RobotCaleb", "noobs2ninjas"]
  ```
* Due to a change in conditions on API usage explained 
  [here](https://blog.twitch.tv/client-id-required-for-kraken-api-calls-afbb8e95f843) Twitch.tv now requires an 
  API key, but we've built a workaround. Use https://wind-bow.gomix.me/twitch-api instead of twitch's API base 
  URL (i.e. https://api.twitch.tv/kraken ) and you'll still be able to get account information, without needing 
  to sign up for an API key
